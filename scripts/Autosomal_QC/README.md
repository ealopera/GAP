## data structure
Important note: this is a self-contained and specific pipeline to work on the UMCG HPC. This means, that at the time, it is not fully automated to work in completeness in any kind of data and any kind of clusters and many steps might be specifically designed for the UGLI data. You are welcome however to take any individual step and/or code snippet to addapt to your own conditions
